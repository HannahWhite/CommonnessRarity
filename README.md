# CommonnessRarity

Investigating the contribution of common and rare species to spatial patterns of biodiversity, in particular functional diversity.

.RData files hold species occurrences (presence/absence) and abundances for nested survey plots of the Machair system on the Western Isles of Scotland. 

pearSR.R, pearFD.R, pearFDabund.R and pearPGFD.R calculates the pearson correlations between the spatial distribution of biodiversity of a subset species and all species, where the subsets are generated by adding species in sequentially from geographically most common to rare and vice versa. The biodiversity measures in each file are species richness, functional dispersion (and RaoQ), abundance-weighted functional dispersion (and RaoQ), and Petchey and Gaston's measure of functional diversity, respectively. The spatial scale can be adapted in these files, however, code for calculating the measures at 5 x 5 m, where the data has to be aggregated, is included in seperate files.

Randomisations for functional diversity and the pearson correlations using these randomisations can be found in randomiseFD.R and randomiseFDabund.R.

SpatialModelsCommon.R and SpatialModelsRare.R use autoregressive models to model the relationship between the proportion of a community made up of rare or common species, and the biodiversity of the community.
